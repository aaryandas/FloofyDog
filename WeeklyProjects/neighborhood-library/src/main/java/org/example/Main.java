/*
Overall no major bugs but some small things. I tried to check in a book that wasn't on the checked in books list
It told me checked in! as a message. It didn't actually check the book in (because it's not on the checked out list)
but the message could be confusing.
I did try to checkout books not on the list and couldn't, so that was good.
Overall solid work, great job breaking things down into methods so it's very readable.
